# Abstract
Temperature data is inherently error prone, with reliance on the accuracy of the
sensors and continuous readings that fall within expected ranges. The Decision Aid
System (DAS) is an online tool for pesticide management and recommendation
that relies heavily on these temperature readings for horticulture models in order
to correctly identify and provide diagnosis. It is essential that quality control is
applied to these temperature readings to ensure that the real time recommendations
by these models correctly reflect the current environment being read by these
weather stations. In this paper, we develop and evaluate approaches to estimating
the parameters of a quality control system based on historical data of a weather
station. Through cross-validation, stations are evaluated on varying years of input
data in order to determine the necessary amount of historical data to successfully
integrate a new station into the system. Our results suggest that each parameter
varies for the necessary amount of prior data to effectively apply quality control on
future data, but never exceeds 5 years.

# Purpose
This repository holds the code use to develop methods for automated quality control and estimates parameters for weather stations, discussed in the above paper.
The code was developed privately, and now made public upon completion of the project. No data can be shared due to privacy agreements, but code does not
reveal any information regarding what is protected.
